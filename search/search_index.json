Hopefully this helps to establish a strong foundation for audio comprehension. I built this to address the \"cheating\" I would do when watching subtitled content - which has its own benefits of improving your reading skills. Study mode is toggle-able, though, so no worries!</p> <p>I'm taking a bit of an audio first or higher audio priority approach here. Audio vocabulary is critical for native level comprehension, so I wanted to aid with more deliberate testing of audio recognition when immersing. Most times people are left to self-assess and self-regulate their recognition and engagement with the content the consume. I realized this bit of automated gamification helps to keep me engaged with the content, and suprisingly the interruptions are a great deal more fun then annoying!</p> <p>Basic Anki-integrated testing works at the moment and going from Yomitan's to Kuromoji's tokenizer has much improved the \"correctness\" of surface form breakdowns. Sentences and words are selected based on Anki maturity. However, smarter word and morpheme recognition success rate based sentence selection and testing are coming!</p> <p>P.S. This uses the kuromoji morphological analyzer in the background, but I may be upgrading it to sudachi for better support for modern and colloquial language.

The 30 day start is rough if you aren't extremely motivated, persistent, or well put together. I found progressively building habits to be helpful. Anki, with its well-defined small task progressions with immediate feedback, is a great anchor habit to first establish. Immersion and sentence mining is where the real challenge begins. You have to hang in there until your grammer and vocabulary provides enough of a foundation to recognize new words in context. Some guides stress simply watching what you are interested in regardless of difficulty, but watching or listening to anything where I can understand the bulk of what is being said has been more engaging for me than a show I should be interested in. I find that being \"interested\" in the topic doesn't necessarily work as an anchor.</li> </ul> </li> <li>donkuri: Opinionated immersion guide similar to the above.</li> <li>ajatt: Also an opinionated immersion guide. So far, I disagree about the uselessness of audio cards - there's quite a bit of literature about phonological traces providing the strongest foundation for building vocabulary on top of. It's also something I observed in my own learning. I can better map orthographic (like kanji) representations of a word to their meaning if I first know a word phonologically (by sound) first. Learning the phonological and orthographic representations simultaneously tended to result in much worse recall. I do believe that they should be used alongside orthogrpahical sentence cards, however. This is super unscientific though, and these guys have much more experience than I do.</li> <li>jimaku: jp subtitles</li> </ul> </li> <li>Makgeolli Brewing:<ul> <li>Takjoo Journals: There's a PDF primer on brewing here I started my first brew with.</li> <li>Moon &amp; Lion Brewing: Another blog!

month or so (probably more) of dipping my toes into the world of regional Chinese food and the Korean diaspora.

I'd seen a few BlondieInChina and some auto-translated videos to evaluate them against, but English language search wasn't returning what I wanted - none of the menus seemed to pass the eye-test.</p> <p>The search results in Chinese were far better, as the reviews labeling the restaurants as \"Chaoxianzu\" or similar were almost entirely in Chinese. This was easy enough to eye-test if you knew what you were looking for. Still a couple places required a lot more digging to find and verify - their menus being so vast and all over the place.</p> <p>I was getting results returning Korean-Chinese food (great but not what I was looking for) and then all manner of very irrelevant Chinese restaurants. </p> <p>Many factors make this search difficult:</p> <ul> <li>Standard Google search returns results for the person with a median-level of interest in food.</li> <li>SEO slop.</li> <li>Keyword based match vs semantic.

This provides a corpus to search over.</p> <p>For each restaurant, an \"average\" embedding of all the menu items is calculated. This gives us a rough preliminary ranking for returning results later.</p> <p>There is an incredible amount of drift based on language. We can think of the embeddings of a language as having their own continents. Items in the same language tend to cluster together. The same menu item in different language might be a further distance from than entirely different menu items in the same language.</p> <p>The search term is processed via an LLM in up to 5 languages. It is not necessarily \"translated\" per say, but the LLM is prompted to provide a culturally-aware search term for semantically searching over menu items in the most relevant languages, weighted by relevance.</p> <p>The average embedding of each reataurant's menu is scored for each language and combined with weight taken into account. This gives us a rough ranking of all the restaurants.</p> <p>Then the ranking is refined. Depending on the page size - number of items returned per page - the chunk of restaurants have each of their menu items scored separately and combined w/ a sort of min-max so that closer matches are weighted higher.</p> <p>This is especially critical w/ diaspora menus. They tend to be less focused and hyper-regional, and may only have a couple hyperregional items on the menu. A Dongbei BBq restaurant serving myeongtae (a North Korean delicacy) will be serving Mapo Tofu amongst other things..</p> <p>The restaurants in a given page are reranked and displayed with their scores. The items that contributed the most to the scores are alost displayed with their scores. They are also clickable to provide an LLM translation and explanation of potential relevance to the search term.</p> <p>This is not entirely reliable, but it's useful if you have less domain knowledge. But always check your results. Also, I think the gradient of results is a wonderful things as you can drift into similar and often related cuisines via search. You might start with Northeastern Chinese BBQ and drift into the foods of Inner Mongolia! You might start with the food of the Pearl River Delta and find Chiu Chow items in Southeast Asian restaurants!</p> <p>There's also a map!</p>","tags":["food"]},{"location":"blog/2025/12/05/forklore/#where-could-this-go","title":"Where could this go?","text":"<p>To be honest, I don't see this getting much traction. There seems to be little value for someone building and hosting the tool and the featured restaurants themselves in scraping menus and transcribing them to yield long-tail searches for the few people who might ever find the site, at least not in a world where the Beli style of eating seems to be on the uptrend.</p> <p>Though perhaps things might change!</p> <p>However, I think there is immediate value in aiding a Google search for such places - be it through standard search or AI-aided search. The bottleneck is in the processing of available information and in the availability of information relevant to the search. Scouring a menu in another language and inferring the regions the items come from is more of a domain specific thing.</p> <p>Many of these restaurants aren't well-labeled and documented unless they've been blessed by some well-meaning boots on the ground.

Decent selection. $250 mystery omakase box. Delivery is like 65 bucks from L.A., though.</li> <li>Noble Fresh Cart: Limited selected (just 2 uni varieties at the time of writing).</li> <li>True World Seafood's Toyosu Express: Only pricey Madai and smoked Yellowtail at the time of writing.</li> <li>Hokkaido Uni Shop: Pretty wide range of products. Pricey, though. No guarantee on handling once it get's in FedEx's hands. Founder world at True World for a while.</li> <li>Sakasyu: If you are a baller with connections, although some say items like uni cost significantly less than Hokkaido Uni Shop (I think this information may be dated - saw a mention on FTC that Sakasyu costs too much for a non-resto entity these days). More of an obscure process to order, too.</li> </ul> <p>There's a bit of SEO jockeying around \"Toyosu fish\" and there's quite a few more sites I didn't yet go through the trouble of vetting but what can you do. Also, depending on where you are, some pickup only spots may be available.</p> <p>A little resourcesfulness in searching, however, gets us to globally shipped Japanese fish for a relative discount. These typically are born from smaller U.S. importers/distributors working with smaller Japanese wholesaling operations out of more obscure ports hoping to establish some presence in the global market. I've even read of chefs working with a dude or two on the grounds at Kyushu fish markets.</p> <p>I'm not entirely sure about the quality of fish compared to those that come through Toyosu - are these wholesalers getting first pick? </p> <p>A good number of restaurants in Japan selling local ingredients actually have to \"buy back\" from Toyosu, since it's such a critical and overwhelmingly dominant distribution hub. There are a select few restaurants where this isn't the case - they establish relationships with fisherman or buy from the lcoal port's markets directly.</p> <p>You're especially in luck if you live in L.A., since many of these operations offer pickup and cheaper delivery. + the benefit of being the first port of entry for such products means less of a chance of your orders getting badly handled.</p> <ul> <li>Ugi Foods: They've got fish coming directly from Shimane Port and I think a partnership with Sol Japan and other wholesalers. I don't know how \"first pick\" the fish are and how reliable the selection is, though I imagine it's fairly decent. (Edit: A little diggin around and Nakaji seems to be coordinating with the folks at Sol Japan to source food from Shimane, so my bet is pretty damn good quality. Tetsu Sushi Bar in Vancouver also sources (possible non-exclusively - sushi bars often have multiple sources) from Sol Japan. This isn't on Sol Japan's blog, though I imagine it would be a good addition... @shimane_fish_love_japan seems to be the most active Sol Japan affilated instagram account.)</li> <li>Yokose Seafood (Toyama Bay): This is the U.S. output of Yokose, a wholesaler in Toyama Bay. Since it's a family business, and since the original business in Japan is quite sizable and handles distribution and packaging of locally sourced ingredients, I can imagine that the quality of the fish and handling is quite good, expecially for local Toyama Bay ingredients (buri, shiro ebi, hotaru ika - they take their pick at the Himi fish market).</li> </ul> <p>I think I'll try my hand at both.</p> <p>Sol Japan seems more aggressively pursuing U.S. distribution, however.

He's grounded in tradition, very value conscious (but wary of words like \"cost-performance\"), and an advocate for underdogs doing things with the right intention. That's how critics should be. He's also capable of being critical, which I find many online enthusiasts are not.</p> <p>I'm gathering that the 3 main battlegrounds of sushi in Japan are: - Tokyo (naturally - the \"Edo\" in Edomae is Tokyo) - Hokkaido - Fukuoka</p> <p>While the \"sushi bubble\" seems to be a nation-wide phenomenon, it seems to be especially prounounced in Tokyo.</p> <p>Prices soar higher, margins become tighter, and there's a sort of sameness and coldness that's permeates a growing percentage of the cities restaurants. But that's the sort of thing that happens when a trend starts to eat itself.</p> <p>The sameness isn't just a vibe thing. As operational efficiency gets optimized on the distribution front, more and more chefs end up sourcing the same product from the same distributors. Locality matters less and less - even chefs from the areas products are produced often have to buy back from Toyosu.</p> <p>Conceptually, Hokkaido's scene seems the most compelling.</p> <p>I'm an outsider trusting word of mouth.</p> <p>The backgrounds of many chefs are untraditional and/or not as prestigious as those in Tokyo, but there seems to be a spirit of craft that's taking root. It's the sort of thing that allows for 5 years of training starting at the ripe old sushi age of 27 to be sufficient to start a restaurant and pump out elite sushi.</p> <p>There's quite an emphasis on lineage and prestife in the Tokyo scene that's not as conducive to this, I think.</p> <p>In short, the sushiyas are extremely personal and the individuality of the voices come through along with quality. Chefs make a point of sourcing directly from local fishermen and fishmongers. They (more) eschew the dynamics that threaten to pull the Tokyo scene into limbo.</p> <p>As long as the work strain is manageable - I'm a big proponent of one person, husband-wife shops.</p> <p>So basically, emphasis on: - craft - quality - personal/functional authenticity</p> <p>The less the last quality is teased out of proprietors, the better. It's a sort of natural anti-saturation mechanism. \"Functional\" meaning that the restaurant knows exactly what it's meant to be and it's constraints and doesn't walk outside of those boundaries. This isn't a call for deliberate individualism, however, though that might seem unintuitive. Ex: the above considered together would emphasize using the highest quality local ingredients (given availability) and a well-adapted approach to those ingredients with the character of local markets and its people in mind. And since sushi is about the micro, even the smallest differences in a chef's character - clearly conveyed - come through with significant impact.</p> <p>An aside: Although I've mentioned the merits of hyperspecific and/or traditional cuisines, one thing I haven't mentioned is a certain burden it lifts from the shoulders of chefs. Individuality doesn't have to aspired to. When diners' scales adjust, naturally differences come through. It's easier said than done, however, and the idea of \"canonical\" cuisine can be misinterpreted as needing to be the basis of this. Ex: If chefs feel, x ingredient is considered important but is strained and comes at a higher cost, then I feel that it's a sign to explore. A la going to underutilized fish.</p> <p>Forcing the use of \"underutilized\" and \"local\" produce doesn't yield the best results, however, when quality is lacking. As always, n + 1 is the most reliable approach. A la, \"this fish is caught and processed with the same attention to detail, is affordable, and is delicious but is avoided by chefs due to extra labor\". Or \"this is the same species that is valued abroad but isn't treated with reverence here, but I can establish a relationship with a fisherman and get it processed as I wish for a fair cost\".</p>","tags":["sushi","food"]},{"location":"blog/2025/02/24/tuesdays-sushi-ish-menu/","title":"Tuesday's Sushi-ish Menu","text":"<p>Some pre-planning.</p> <p>I'm going to get my hands on some fish.</p> <p>Options are:  - Masaba (Chub Mackerel) - Aji (Horse Mackerel) - Buri (Yellowtail) - Kamasu (Barracuda) - Sawara (Spanish Mackerel) - Aka Ika (Swordtip Squid) - Ama Ebi (Pandalus Borealis) - Tai (Japanese Sea Bream)</p> <p>Got to get a fairly small amount.

Not Reddit, which is the where many people first turn to.</p> <p>Reddit is accessible and it has dedicated forums to fine dining and the L.A. food scene. However, the opinions I tend to look for are those that tend to stand the test of time and education. Those that hold up the more you learn about food.

When I was eating my way around Montreal, I made a point of making my way through the social graphs of the local food scene.</p> <p>Follow restaurants. Follow chefs.

However, though we on the West Coast have access to the same species of Pacific Mackerel as they do in Japan (scomber japonicus), it's hard to find mackerel that you'd be comfortable eating raw outside of the mass-produced somewhat vinegar-heavy and pungent shime-saba you'd get at the local Japanese markets. I believe it's classic fare for homemade lunchbox-style sushi but not what I was looking for. </p> <p>It makes sense. There's a lot working against having quality raw pacific mackerel in the States:</p> <ul> <li>Demand: Mackerel doesn't fit the palate of most stateside folk, though it's a staple in many other cultures. </li> <li>Processing: With little demand for mackerel in the first place and little emphasis placed on quality, mackerel isn't babied - well bled, gutted, iced, and perhaps ike &amp; shinkei-jimed (though most mackerel even in Japan is left to die in ice - though I suspect the stuff intended for raw consumption is more delicately dealth with).</li> <li>Natural spoilage: Mackerel has the tendency to spoil and get fishy quickly. Coupled with poor processing, even mackerel that makes it to the ports quickly after being landed could be less than ideal.</li> <li>FDA Regulations: Fish sold for raw consumption in the U.S. must be superfrozen to comply with FDA regulations, else the burden of proof that a fish is safe to eat raw lies on the seller (research they typically cannot afford).</li> </ul> <p>My best bet would be to hit the docks, settle on the most quality-obsessed fisherman bartering mackerel available, and roll the die on the fish.</p> <p>Either that or spend 50 bucks / lb on the stuff from Toyosu via Yama. + shipping.</p> <p>This inconvenience had me thinking about how nice it would be for a local business to focus solely on producing (from catch to sale) high quality, FDA compliant, easily accessible (deals with local Asian grocery chains a la HMart, Tokyo Central, 99 Ranch) intendednt-for-raw-consumption mackerel. And make a living off the single product alone (it's a staple innit - and word gets around certain Asian communities fast regarding food products). And packaging the product nicely, too. Perhaps running a sakana-ya a la Osakana NYC for extra local brownie points.</p> <p>Needless to say, I've been orbiting the idea of single product sourcing and processing.</p> <p>And as this thought floated around in my head, I came across @shiroebi_mizubun on Instagram - a company based out of Toyama, Japan dedicated to producing a single raw local product - Toyama Bay (\u5bcc\u5c71\u6e7e) Shiro-Ebi (\u767d\u3048\u3073) for retail consumption.</p> <p>I'll give a truncated description since their background is best covered on their site and in this article:</p> <ul> <li>Shiro-Ebi Mizubun (\u767d\u3048\u3073\u6c34\u6587) is the retail brand under Mizubun (\u6c34\u6587), the only white shrimp specialty store in Toyama Bay.</li> <li>While Shiro-Ebi Mizubun's sales started in the 2025 and it's first HAACP certified factory was established in 2022, Mizubun has been around for longer producing white shrimp sashimi for businesses (restaurant use).</li> <li>It came about as the peeling process was discovered due to the propagation of freezing technology - by coincidence it was discovered that freezing and thawing left gaps between the shells and the meat (due toe differing freezing rates) that allowed for the raw meat to be separated from the shells more easily. Freezing is done at -25C (lower temperature don't separate the meat from the shell as well as the whole unit freeezes too quickly).</li> <li>Mizubun transitioned from a half-and-half sashimi production and shrimp brokering to full sashimi production in 2004.</li> <li>Mizubun peels all shrimps by hand instead of machine to preserve texture, flavor, and color.</li> <li>Mizubun has been selling to a major conveyor belt chain since about 2018 - they aim more for the ikura and uni category.</li> <li>Mizubun's discarded shells have been used to make crackers and other flavored goods.</li> <li>Mizubun does sell whole shrimp, but sashimi makes up 90% of their sales.</li> <li>Mizubun plans to expand globally this year.</li> </ul> <p>I'm sure there's a lot of press shine to the information I could get, but it's an interesting niche and approach: focusing on the production and distribution of a single process-sensitive hyperlocal product and targeting an expanding middle high-end market.</p> <p>Also interesting is the accessibility of quality seafood in Japan.

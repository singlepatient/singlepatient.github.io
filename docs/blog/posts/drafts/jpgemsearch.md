# Food Opinion Networks

What's my starting point when searching for restaurants?

As an L.A. diner with no connections, it's FoodTalkCentral. Not Reddit, which is the where many people first turn to.

> Reddit is accessible and it has dedicated forums to fine dining and the L.A. food scene. However, the opinions I tend to look for are those that tend to stand the test of time and education. Those that hold up the more you learn about food. The ones that send you places you appreciate more over time, rather than less. Those that come from people with stronger opinions on what honest good food means. Reddit can feel a little diluted in this regard. I like having a higher hit rate, since my folks aren't made of money.

The self-selecting groups that end up on the post-Chowhound forums tend to be more knowledgeable (possibly snobby). Also, FoodTalkCentral seems to be a bit more hardass than HungryOnion, which feels like a plus. It's not the most active place on the interwebs, as it has a fairly low number of regular users, but it has a regularly beating pulse and tends to be ahead of the curve.

My other starting point is the socials of chefs and food industry professionals (especially wholesalers and distributors). When I was eating my way around Montreal, I made a point of making my way through the social graphs of the local food scene.

Follow restaurants.
Follow chefs.
View tags and snarky inside joke comments from fellow chefs and look for *opinionated* independent diners. Reviewers associated with the local press can be pretty well-connected and knowledgeable but I get the feeling that their prioritization of neutrality and the publishing of regular content gets in the way of good direction.

Ex: Restaurant Beba's account (which I deeply regret cancelling my reservation at) was a goldmine in terms of attracting strong opinions.
The account is run with no filter by the chef.
It's deeply "gastronomic" in a way.
And it's caviar distributors seem quite opinionated, too.

You then make your way around those opinion networks and note all the restaurants they deem worth going. Especially for places abroad - you'll often find some places with minimal information on the internet otherwise. It's as close to word-of-mouth as you can get while being antisocial - they've got friends and fixers you don't.

> Higher hit rate when they say something like "x restaurant is one of the few restaurants on the continent cooking at a high-level".

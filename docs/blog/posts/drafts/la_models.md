# Foos in US sprawl
Specialist restaurants are significantly more common in ethnic communities.

Unlike in white suburbia, the food landscape seems to get significantly better in areas where strip malls and plazas are packed together. Options are more accessible, more densely packed togehter (than the rest of la), and there's a possible flow from one bang to the next. Not to mention parking.

While produce in California can get quite good - few people grow with obsession. There's no bamboo shoots worth hundreds. No grades of wasabi.

A Weiser Family Farms melon is just a melon and the grower will tell you there's no secret to picking one cause they're all good and the variety is nature's choice.

> In a way, not a bad philosophy. But also not what I want in a $$$$ course menu. But! at $$ and $$$...

The cooking culture is not obsessive and substantial enough for higher grades, however. Supply meet demand and all that.

I imagine that cooperatives *might* be able to push quality a la four-star but woof its behind.

Considering Nishinokaze is able to source good local button shrimp with little demand, though, it seems that upping quality without significant scale is possible, although there might be considerably lessnoticible variability in terms of quality when it comes to button shrimp....

In LA, the diners are...
considerably less educated on the high end.

Which makes sense considering the small returns.
They *could* break through the ceilings by going international but...

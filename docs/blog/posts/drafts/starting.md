# Starting the blog

I wanted to establish a single place to aggregate my interests and put them out in the "open".

I also wanted a place where I could practice condensing my thoughts so I can hold onto them for longer and better communicate them.

At the moment, I am:

- learning Japanese
- refining my restaurant search techniques :\)
- developing a perspective on food
- cooking
- prepping for the LSAT (lofty goals)
- reaching for professional illustrator level in my free time

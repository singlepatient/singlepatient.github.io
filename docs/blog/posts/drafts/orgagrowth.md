# the neet's guide towards

The typical neet has a lot of mental energy.
This might sound counterintiutive - but few NEETs ever *really* live in a vacuum.

They typically spend their mental energies on:
- anime
- fandom
- the collection of "useless" information

Actually, the average NEET is more likely to be passionately multi-interested...

So. What about employing NEETs?
There should be quite a few who are extremely skilled.

> You trade comfortable employment for high skill (mostly intuition) labor. Online sensibility is rare and important.

Secondhand information is far more appealing than you might think.

> Forum crawler?


Things to do?
- Amass a large document of accounts to follow.

The greatest shops (IMO) pursue almost artifically organic growth.
They ask for the customers to be complicit in it's low-keyness.
They take phone reservations only so that only the most desicated/local customers come in.

> This is preventative more than it is reactive. After a certain point wrt to fame it becomes competitive.

They nearly eliminate their online presence.we

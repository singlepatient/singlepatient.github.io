# Automate the atomic breakdown of minded material into progressive and parallel learning materials

When you mine a sentence you should more or less get:

- An audio sentence card
- Kanji component cards (for the selected word)
- An orthographic vocabulary card
- Grammer concept card (?)

The audio sentence and kanji component cards support the learning of a word orthographically.

# Take a trace first approach

I observed that having an existing phonological trace made it easier to recall the meaning of a word via its orthographic representation.

There are probably all types of foundational traces elsewhere similar to this.

# Model forgetting curves for words and kanji that sound or look similar to words you've learned

I've found that the greatest source of "forgetting" has been in mixing up a word with a word you've learned previously. And forgetting curves are known to be steeper in these cases. This mostly applies orthographically as a word you listen to is easily context informed.

> I think a strong Kanji base is required. Easy to mix them up, though combinations in words do have an associative quality, but this can often be confusing for self assessment of how well you remember.

I feel like there can be some radicals based approach to this along with computer vision based approaches.

# Prioritize deliberately testing audio comprehension via audio vocabulary and natural breakdown

Language is spoken and listened to before it is written and read.

The biggest factor in audio comprehension is audio vocabulary. Audio vocabulary explodes with the morpheme stacking of agglutinative languages. 

Native speakers have natural recognition and breakdown skills later learners typically don't exercise and test early on, nor are often prompted to exercise early on. We usually tell immersion learners to stay sharp and rely on discipline to do this. We can take the load of of them, in this regard.

# Prioritize habit building and volume over pure efficiency

One of Anki's greatest uses is as an emotional crutch. It gives you the confidence to keep engaging with learning. Though elaborately encoding a memory makes the encoding stronger, sustaining the habit of learning is more important.

I found that starting with a basic premade deck and sustaining my habit later gave me the confidence to start mining little by little. You can get more elaborate once you build consistency.

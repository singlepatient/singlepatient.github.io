# Rice Sources

Some decent online sources of rice:

- [The Rice Factory New York](https://trf-ny.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqQzDLTxzeQWHM_75_4fhuJsHRbNfhhuysrATPPHcVNkD9vUHvW)/[The Rice Factory Los Angeles](https://trf-la.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopE6HYsn4ATt7OU9Dy_xeE8AIAudzAHoNNH5nTYkJrtTR73hk5I): Honolulu spin-off. Japanese rice milled to order. Some rare and naturally grown varieties. Supplies high-end New York restuarants.
- [KimC Market](https://kimcmarket.com/collections/korean-rice): Seem to be following The Rice Factory's model. Korean rice milled to order. Rare and naturally grown varieties. Suppleis high-end New York restaurants.

> As for the latter, the high-end New York Korean restaurant boom is probably fueling this.

Also interesting, but Korea-only: [Farm Woobo](https://farmwoobo.com/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaa3kBk5I8WsCq6o8JsyXtubIWCS28Q6nY0Cc3sgCtoQddVCzcpXaWDJkKo_aem_dfkK-oUH15t5zySA10o14w) with 400+ varieties of natirally grown heirloom rice. Admittedly more in the extremes in terms of flavor and texture.

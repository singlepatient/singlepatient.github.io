# Sui Bot

The single most intensive project I've undertaken is [arbisui](https://github.com/singlepatient/arbisui), a Sui DEX arbitrage bot.

The codebase is a mess outside of the tooling, and things could be done a lot better. However, I think I did a fair bit of pioneering on the chain, though I didn't take it to the massive profit finish line.

I was somewhat familiar with MEV and on-chain arbitrage due to sort of finding myself in the right(?) Twitter circles and Discords, and though I'd always wanted to try, it felt a bit daunting to my very junior engineer self - increasingly more so since competition on the big chains included the known big quant firms and whatnot.

I hadn't really done much in terms of completing projects, and though I had a CS degree almost tucked into my belt, I lacked of professional experience and exposure. But the folks in the field said sometimes "easier" money comes around. New chains pop up with smaller but less competitive opportunities, the tradeoff being that you have to "eat glass" and work around lack of dev-tooling, documents, young badly-written protocols, node access, infrastructure, etc. Enter uncharted territory, a good place to skill up.

But, oof, lotsa stuff had to be done. 

The deep dive is in the [repo](https://github.com/singlepatient/bitechain).

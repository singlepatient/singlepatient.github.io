# Korean-Inspired Ceramics

Many major styles of Japanese pottery originate with Korean ceramicists (Imjin/Tea Bowl wars and all that), but that aside, there are more contemporary names who strive to recreate the styles and techniques in earnest.

There's the classic saying "Raku first, Hagi second, Karatsu third" but there seems to be another variant "Ido first, Hagi second, Karatsu third" - Ido being the imported Korean ware that preceded the natively produced wares by "imported" Korean ceramicists and their descendants and students.

Anyways, with the reverence of tea culture and tea culture history in Japan + the Korean ceramics intertwined roots of the Mingei movement, there seems to have been fertile ground to produce artists who look to Korean techniques and styles and strive to faithfully recreate them.

My entry point was [Hosokawa Morihiro](http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/hosokawa-morihiro-jt.html) (coincidentally a former Prime Minister of Japan) who strived to make works inspired by the Momoyama Period and the Korean Joseon Dynasty Period.

His mentors and inspirations included:
- [Tsujimura Shiro](http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/tsujimura-shiro-jt-03.html) who dedicated much of his life to Ido chawan.
- [Togo Kobayashi](http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/t-kobayashi.html) finds inspiration in Yi Dynasty ceramics, even establishing a kiln on Tsushima Island for the seclusion and clay which is reportedly as close as it gets to Korean clay on Japanese territory.

Hosting collections by further artists inspired by Korean wares is [Gallery Ichibankan](https://www.1bankan.com/en?srsltid=AfmBOoqvuwAeKh4EzlI0cfzx_Ug9emSHW8coNHpsOMbWDVyB5R-2Gty1), as one of the directors has a personal interest in Joseon wares:

- [Shintaro Uchimura](https://www.1bankan.com/en/collections/uchimura-shintaro): Joseon-dynasty-inspired and karatsu wares
- [Takesue Hiomi](https://www.1bankan.com/en/collections/takesue-hiomi): a student of Togo Kobayashi, also on Tsushima island producing Joseon dynasty inspired wares
- [Munehiko Maruta](https://www.1bankan.com/en/blogs/artists/munehiko-maruta): produced Ido-inspired and Karatsu ware
- [Yasumoto Kajiwars](https://www.1bankan.com/en/blogs/artists/yasumoto-kajihara): produces old Karatsu and holds and interesy in ancient Korean pottery

> Note: The line between inspired by ancient Korean wares and old Karatsu and other Korean lineage styles can get blurry. Ceramicists are students of the craft and pull from multiple inspirations. Also the naming is throwing me off a bit for some stuff but I'll just have to educate myself a bit more. The best resources are overwhelmingly in Japanese.

> Note: This is all preliminary. The world of pottery goes deep.

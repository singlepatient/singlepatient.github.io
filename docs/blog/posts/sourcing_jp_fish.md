# Notes on Sourcing Japanese Fish in the States as a Home Chef

The most involved sushi nerds in the states tend not to compromise on wild Japanese fish.

So, generally a hard pass on the likes of the non-Japanese origin and/or farmed fish which are generally what the more budget-minded r/sushi folks reach for:

- Riviera Seafood Club
- Honolulu Fish Company
- Catalina Offshore Products

It's not easy to get your hands on hand-selected imported Japanese seafood for a non-eyewatering price, though. Especially when you factor in shipping.

A la the big 'uns:

- Regalis: Somewhat limited. No mystery box. Pricey.
- Yama: Outta New York. Decent selection. $250 mystery omakase box. Delivery is like 65 bucks from L.A., though.
- Noble Fresh Cart: Limited selected (just 2 uni varieties at the time of writing).
- True World Seafood's Toyosu Express: Only pricey Madai and smoked Yellowtail at the time of writing.
- Hokkaido Uni Shop: Pretty wide range of products. Pricey, though. No guarantee on handling once it get's in FedEx's hands. Founder world at True World for a while.
- Sakasyu: If you are a baller with connections, although some say items like uni cost significantly less than Hokkaido Uni Shop (I think this information may be dated - saw a [mention on FTC](www.foodtalkcentral.com) that Sakasyu costs too much for a non-resto entity these days). More of an obscure process to order, too.

> There's a bit of SEO jockeying around "Toyosu fish" and there's quite a few more sites I didn't yet go through the trouble of vetting but what can you do. Also, depending on where you are, some pickup only spots may be available.

A little resourcesfulness in searching, however, gets us to globally shipped Japanese fish for a relative discount. These typically are born from smaller U.S. importers/distributors working with smaller Japanese wholesaling operations out of more obscure ports hoping to establish some presence in the global market. I've even read of chefs working with a dude or two on the grounds at Kyushu fish markets.

I'm not entirely sure about the quality of fish compared to those that come through Toyosu - are these wholesalers getting first pick? 

> A good number of restaurants in Japan selling local ingredients actually have to "buy back" from Toyosu, since it's such a critical and overwhelmingly dominant distribution hub. There are a select few restaurants where this isn't the case - they establish relationships with fisherman or buy from the lcoal port's markets directly.

You're especially in luck if you live in L.A., since many of these operations offer pickup and cheaper delivery. + the benefit of being the first port of entry for such products means less of a chance of your orders getting badly handled.

- [Ugi Foods](https://www.ugi-us.com/shop): They've got fish coming directly from Shimane Port and I think a partnership with [Sol Japan](https://en.sol.co.jp) and other wholesalers. I don't know how "first pick" the fish are and how reliable the selection is, though I imagine it's fairly decent. (Edit: A little diggin around and [Nakaji](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DE3jafvMwjo/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) seems to be coordinating with the folks at Sol Japan to source food from Shimane, so my bet is pretty damn good quality. Tetsu Sushi Bar in Vancouver also sources (possible non-exclusively - sushi bars often have multiple sources) from Sol Japan. This isn't on Sol Japan's blog, though I imagine it would be a good addition... [@shimane_fish_love_japan](https://www.instagram.com/shimane_fish_love_japan?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) seems to be the most active Sol Japan affilated instagram account.)
- [Yokose Seafood](https://www.yokose-seafood.com) (Toyama Bay): This is the U.S. output of [Yokose](https://www.kk-yokose.co.jp), a wholesaler in Toyama Bay. Since it's a family business, and since the original business in Japan is quite sizable and handles distribution and packaging of locally sourced ingredients, I can imagine that the quality of the fish and handling is quite good, expecially for local Toyama Bay ingredients (buri, shiro ebi, hotaru ika - they take their pick at the Himi fish market).

I think I'll try my hand at both.

Sol Japan seems more aggressively pursuing U.S. distribution, however. Yokose is nearly a one man operation.

> Yokose's socials and sites aren't often updated and the availability and hours are irregular (the proprietor does deliveries to restaurants), so it's best to give him a call. He seems like a sweetheart, though.
